							<h1>monthly timeline</h1>
							 <h4>January 2019<h4>
							 <p><h6>DESIGNED PPID(PREDICTIVE PROPORTIONAL INTEGRAL DERIVATIVE) ADVANCED CONTROL ALGORITHM, WHICH GIVES FUTURE DATA BASED ON THE PAST OUTPUTS. WE WORKED ON CONICAL TANK, DISTILLATION COLUMN, AND HEAT EXCHANGER. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO publishing OUR RESEARCH PAPER SOON.</p></h6>


							<h4>April 2019</h4>
							<p><h6>
								Joined R.U.G.V.E.D under electronics subsystem.
								<br> 
R.U.G.V.E.D IS A STUDENT PROJECT, WHICH MAKES AI BASED BOTS FOR MILITARY WHERE BOT HAVE WORK UNDER HARSH ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS.</h6>

							<h4>May 2019</h4>	
							<h6>
							<p> WORKED AS INTERN AT (NTPC) NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION WHERE OUR TRAINER GAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PLANT, AND WE LEARNT THE WORKING OF DCS(DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEM) ALSO WE GOT GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO CALIBRATE SENSORS USED IN THE PLANT.  </p></h6>

								<br>
							<h4>October 2019</h4>
							<h5>Won wearable device hackathon</h5>
							<h6><p>Short description of the event.<br>
								<p>Preliminary round.<br>
								Day 1: The participants had to come up with ideas that could be implemented as a wearable medical device.<br>
								Day2: The teams discuss on the solution and way to implement it and make a presentation.<br>
								Day3: the teams pitch their ideas to judges.<br>
								About 18 teams presented their ideas of which 8 were selected to the finals where we would pitch our idea along with a small prototype.<br>
								Finals round: We presented our idea with the prototype and won the competition with 10k funding and 15k cash prize.<br>
								Our idea:(Team name -Shot Trackers) What if we could prevent injuries in basketball by analysing the players technique during practice sessions and giving feedback on weight distribution and landing angles to prevent major injuries.<br>
								Our prototype: Using an Arduino Nano and bluetooth module along with 3-axis accelerometer and force sensitive resistor sensor we captured some valuable data with which we could predict the angle at which the ankle was wrt to the ground when the played landed.<br>
									FURTHER PLANS : Improving prototype by using fsr matrix on insole, better filtering tuning and analysis of data from sensors also making a bigger data set so that algorithms from ML and AI can be used to make our prototype efficient.<br></p></h6>
